# Web scraping biotech company information

As a final year bioinformatics PhD student, I decided to try and make the job hunt a little more enjoyable by automating and standardising the process of finding companies that I would be interested in working for. Here, I use [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io) to find details of all UK companies within the field of Biotechnnology. 

# Disclaimer

I do not recommend web scraping in any way. If you do web scrape, please respect the Terms of Service and [robots.txt](https://www.promptcloud.com/blog/how-to-read-and-respect-robots-file/) of the site you scrape. For more information on the legality of web scraping, you may find this [blog](https://benbernardblog.com/web-scraping-and-crawling-are-perfectly-legal-right/) useful.

It's worth mentioning that due to the ever-updating nature of many websites, it's unlikely that these scripts remain re-runnable out-of-the-box.
